# STATE: MermaidStudio

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-23T15:44:54Z
**Last Session:** 2026-03-26T12:48:44.976Z
**Stopped At:** Completed 11-03-PLAN.md
**Current Phase:** 11
**Progress:** [████████░░] 84%

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Users prefer MermaidStudio over Mermaid Live Editor because of its polished interface, AI assistance, and better editing experience.

**Current Focus:** Phase 11 — Node Style Editing in Preview

**Key Constraints:**

- React + TypeScript stack with Vite build system
- LocalStorage-first storage (~5-10MB limit)
- Static hosting only (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- User-configured API keys for provider flexibility
- Mermaid version pinned to 11.13.0

## Current Position

Phase: 11 (Node Style Editing in Preview) — EXECUTING
Plan: 5 of 5

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 6 added: please do the refactoring like explained in chat history
- Phase 7 added: Fix all security issues identified in code analysis
- Phase 11 added: Node style editing in preview (couleur, border, taille du border, couleur du border, etc.) — mêmes fonctionnalités que Mermaid Live Editor

### Key Decisions Made

**2026-03-22 (Roadmap Creation):**

- Chose 5-phase structure based on natural requirement groupings
- Prioritized fixing AI integration first (critical blocker)
- Split Visual Editor AI into separate phase (requires major technical debt work)
- Made Security & Reliability final phase (cross-cutting safeguards)

**2026-03-22 (Phase 6 Context Gathering):**

- Folder structure: By concern (aiProviders→services/ai/, db→services/storage/, mermaid→lib/mermaid/, constants→constants/)
- Path aliases: Explicit (@/components, @/lib, @/services, @/types, @/hooks, @/constants) with flatter component style (@/ai, @/editor)
- Migration: All at once, atomic import updates, build+type check validation
- Types: Split by domain with umbrella barrel export

**2026-03-22 (Plan 06-02C - Constants Folder):**

- Created src/constants/ directory for static configuration data
- Moved colorPalettes.ts and templates.ts from src/lib/ to src/constants/
- Preserved git history using git mv
- Separated immutable definitions from business logic

**2026-03-22 (Plan 06-02A - Services Layer):**

- Created src/services/ai/ and src/services/storage/ directories
- Moved AI providers from src/lib/aiProviders.ts to src/services/ai/providers.ts
- Moved database from src/lib/db.ts to src/services/storage/database.ts
- Preserved git history using git mv
- Separated external service integrations from utilities

**2026-03-22 (Plan 06-02B - Mermaid Folder):**

- Consolidated all Mermaid utilities in src/lib/mermaid/ folder
- Files moved: mermaid.ts → core.ts, mermaidAutocomplete.ts → autocomplete.ts, mermaidCodeUtils.ts → codeUtils.ts, mermaidLanguage.ts → language.ts
- Preserved git history using git mv
- Created domain-based organization for Mermaid-specific functionality

**2026-03-22 (Plan 06-03A - Type Extraction):**

- Created domain type files: ai.ts, storage.ts, mermaid.ts, ui.ts
- Extracted type definitions from monolithic index.ts
- Used import() syntax for cross-domain type references to avoid circular dependencies
- Two-step strategy: create copies first, replace index.ts in plan 03B
- Preserved original types in index.ts for verification

**2026-03-22 (Plan 06-03B - Umbrella Barrel Export):**

- Replaced monolithic types/index.ts with umbrella barrel export
- Converted 145 lines of type definitions to 4 re-export statements
- Export all domain files: ai, storage, mermaid, ui
- Provides single import point: `import type { Diagram } from '@/types'`
- Maintains domain organization for better code structure
- Type check verified: 0 import errors from types/index.ts

**2026-03-22 (Plan 06-05A - Modal Subdirectories):**

- Created modal subdirectories: settings/, tools/, diagram/
- Moved 10 modal files from flat structure to functional subdirectories
- Settings modals: AdvancedStylePanel, DiagramColorsPanel, MermaidConfigModal
- Tools modals: BackupPanel, CommandPalette, KeyboardShortcuts
- Diagram modals: ExportModal, SaveTemplateModal, TemplateLibrary, VersionHistory
- Two-phase strategy: file moves (05A) then import updates (05B)
- Preserved git history using git mv

**2026-03-22 (Plan 06-05B - Modal Import Updates):**

- Updated all modal import statements to use new subdirectory paths
- Diagram modals now use `/diagram/` prefix (TemplateLibrary, VersionHistory, ExportModal, SaveTemplateModal)
- Tools modals now use `/tools/` prefix (CommandPalette, KeyboardShortcuts, BackupPanel)
- Settings modals already using `/settings/` prefix (no changes needed)
- Type check verified: 0 import errors
- Modal reorganization complete

**2026-03-22 (Plan 07-00 - Test Infrastructure Setup):**

- Installed Vitest framework with jsdom environment for DOM testing
- Configured coverage reporting with 80% thresholds for security utilities
- Created test stubs for all security utilities following TDD workflow
- Adopted TDD approach: test stubs created first (RED phase) before implementation
- Test infrastructure ready for security implementation in subsequent plans
- Duration: 4 minutes, 3 tasks completed, 8 files modified

**2026-03-22 (Plan 07-04 - Gap Closure):**

- Deleted orphaned sanitization.test.ts file that imported from non-existent module
- Restored test suite to full passing status (8/8 test files, 88 tests)
- SVG sanitization coverage maintained in core.test.ts
- Decision: Delete orphaned test file rather than create sanitization.ts module (implementation already in core.ts)
- Duration: 28 seconds, 1 task completed, 1 file deleted

**2026-03-23 (Plan 08-01 - Fix Build Infrastructure):**

- Verified ESLint 10.1.0 with @eslint/js integration working correctly
- Resolved peer dependency conflict with eslint-plugin-react-hooks using canary version
- Used --legacy-peer-deps to install transitive dependencies
- npm run lint and npm run typecheck both operational
- Decision: Use canary build of eslint-plugin-react-hooks for ESLint 10 compatibility
- Duration: 3 minutes, 4 tasks verified complete, work already done in 08-00

### Architecture Decisions

**From PROJECT.md:**

- Local-first storage (simplicity, privacy, no backend)
- Multi-provider AI support (user choice, avoid vendor lock-in)
- CodeMirror 6 for editor (best-in-class code editing)
- No user accounts (reduce complexity, ship faster)

**From Research:**

- Replace manual fetch with official SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Implement custom hooks for state management (useAIChat, useAIProvider, useAIRetry)
- Add error boundary for AI features
- Encrypt API keys with Web Crypto API
- Fix CORS with backend proxy (Vite proxy for dev, serverless for prod)

### Technical Debt Identified

**From Codebase Audit:**

- AI API connection not working (PRIMARY BLOCKER)
- LocalStorage quota failures handled silently
- Performance: unnecessary re-renders, Mermaid renders on every keystroke
- Visual editor parsing logic fragile (heavy regex, breaks on Mermaid syntax changes)
- Zero test coverage (critical gap for reliability)
- TypeScript `as any` assertions throughout codebase
- Empty catch blocks hiding errors

### Known Issues

**Critical:**

- AI integration completely broken (CORS errors, missing retry logic, no timeouts)
- API keys stored in plaintext in localStorage (security vulnerability)

**Important:**

- Model names are incorrect (gpt-5.x, claude-4.6 don't exist)
- Missing AbortController for request cancellation
- No streaming support (responses wait for completion)
- Generic error messages (not actionable)

**Nice to have:**

- Code completion not implemented
- No token/cost tracking
- Request deduplication missing

## Session Continuity

**If returning after break:**

1. Review current phase status in this STATE.md
2. Check ROADMAP.md for phase success criteria
3. Review REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table
4. Run `/gsd:plan-phase N` where N is current phase number
